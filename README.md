# 🏦 Credit Risk Modeling: Home Credit Default Risk

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to **predict the probability that an applicant will default on a loan**. By building a credit risk model using machine learning, we aim to help financial institutions **identify high-risk clients** and make better lending decisions.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Home Credit provides loans to people with little or no credit history. Traditional banking methods don't always work for such applicants, so it's important to build a reliable predictive model that uses alternative data sources to assess credit risk.

This project aims to solve the following challenges:

- Predict the **likelihood of default** for loan applicants
- Use a variety of **financial, demographic, and historical credit data**
- Create a robust **machine learning model** using structured data
- Track, tune, and evaluate model performance to ensure generalizability
